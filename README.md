# lexconvert
Convert phoneme codes and lexicon formats for English speech synths, from http://ssb22.user.srcf.net/lexconvert/
(also mirrored at http://ssb22.gitlab.io/lexconvert/ just in case, plus you can access Lexconvert via `pip install lexconvert` or `pipx run lexconvert`)

As a person with limited vision, I often use speech synthesis software to read things. Some uncommon words (such as names and places in literature) are pronounced wrongly by speech synthesizers, but if the synthesizer has a user-controlled pronunciation dictionary (lexicon) then this can be used to correct its pronunciation where necessary. However, if you move to a different speech synthesizer, you may find the lexicon format is different.

This is a Python program that converts between different codes for English phonemes and between lexicon files. It supports quite a few, and there is information in the Python file about how to add your own. It works in both Python 2 and Python 3.

example
: A small built-in example lexicon for testing when you don't have your full custom lexicon to hand.  Use `--convert` to write it in one of the other formats and see if a synth can import it.

festival
: Festival's British voice

festival-cmu
: American CMU version of Festival

kana-approx
: Rough approximation using kana (for getting Japanese computer voices to speak some English words; works with some words better than others).  Set `KANA_TYPE` environment variable to hiragana or katakana (which can affect the sounds of some voices); default is hiragana

keynote

sapi
: Microsoft Speech API (American English)

speakjet
: Allophone codes for the American English "SpeakJet" speech synthesis chip (the conversion from phonemes to allophones might need tweaking).  Set the `SPEAKJET_SYM` environment variable to use mnemonics, otherwise numbers are used (set `SPEAKJET_BINARY` for binary output).

unicode-ipa
: IPA symbols in Unicode, as used by an increasing number of dictionary programs, websites etc

unicode-ipa-syls
: Like unicode-ipa but with syllable separators preserved (note however that this cannot generate syllable separator markers that do not already exist in the input, it merely preserves any already there)

unicode-rough
: A non-standard notation that's reminiscent of unicode-ipa but changed so that more of the characters show in old browsers with incomplete fonts

vocaloid
: X-SAMPA phonemes for Yamaha's Vocaloid singing synthesizer.  Contributed by Lorenzo Gatti, who tested in Vocaloid 4 using two American English voices.

x-sampa
: General X-SAMPA notation, contributed by Jan Weiss

x-sampa-strict
: A stricter version of X-SAMPA, which can distinguish between sounds not distinct in British English when converting to/from IPA, but might not work on all voices

yinghan
: As unicode-ipa but, when converting a user lexicon, generates Python code that reads Wenlin Yinghan dictionary entries and adds IPA bands to matching words

Program options
---------------

--convert `<from-format>` `<to-format>`
: Convert a user lexicon (generally from its default filename; if this cannot be found then lexconvert will tell you what it should be).  
E.g.: `python lexconvert.py` `--convert` festival cepstral

--parens `<format>` [`<words>`]
: Like `--ruby` but outputs just text with parenthesised pronunciation after each word, for pasting into instant messaging etc.  
E.g.: `python lexconvert.py` `--parens` unicode-ipa This is a test sentence.  
Beware, the considerations about eSpeak versions that apply to `--ruby` also apply here.

--phones `<format>` [`<words>`]
: Use eSpeak to convert text to phonemes, and then convert the phonemes to format `<format>`.  
E.g.: `python lexconvert.py` `--phones` unicode-ipa This is a test sentence.  
Set environment variable `PHONES_PIPE_COMMAND` to an additional command to which to write the phones as well as standard output.  (If standard input is a terminal then this will be done separately after each line.)  
(Some commercial speech synthesizers do not work well when driven entirely from phonemes, because their internal format is different and is optimised for normal text.)  
Set format to 'all' if you want to see the phonemes in *all* supported formats.

--phones2phones `<format1>` `<format2>` [`<phonemes in format1>`]
: Perform a one-off conversion of phonemes from format1 to format2 (format2 can be 'all' if you want)

--ruby `<format>` [`<words>`]
: Like `--phones` but outputs the result as HTML RUBY markup, with each word's pronunciation symbols placed above the corresponding English word.  
E.g.: `python lexconvert.py` `--ruby` unicode-ipa This is a test sentence.  
This option is made more complicated by the fact that different versions of eSpeak may space the phoneme output differently, for example when handling numbers; if your eSpeak version is not recognised then all numbers are unannotated. Anyway you are advised not to rely on this option working with the new development NG versions of eSpeak. If the version you have behaves unexpectedly, words and phonemes output might lose synchronisation. However this option is believed to be stable when used with simple text and the original eSpeak.  
You can optionally set the `RUBY_GRADINT_CGI` environment variable to the URL of an instance of Gradint Web Edition to generate audio links for each word.  If doing this in a Web Adjuster filter, see comments in the lexconvert source for setup details.

--try `<format>` [`<pronunciation>`]
: Convert input from `<format>` into eSpeak and try it out.  
(Requires the 'espeak' command.)  
E.g.: `python lexconvert.py` `--try` festival h @0 l ou1  
 or: `python lexconvert.py` `--try` unicode-ipa `'\u02c8\u0279\u026adn\u0329'` (for Unicode put `'\uNNNN'` or UTF-8)

--trymac `<format>` [`<pronunciation>`]
: Convert phonemes from `<format>` into Mac and try it using the Mac OS 'say' command

--trymac-uk `<format>` [`<pronunciation>`]
: Convert phonemes from `<format>` and try it with Mac OS British voices (see `--mac-uk` for details)

--festival-dictionary-to-espeak `<location>`
: Convert the Festival Oxford Advanced Learners Dictionary (OALD) pronunciation lexicon to eSpeak.  
You need to specify the location of the OALD file in `<location>`,  
e.g. for Debian festlex-oald package: `python lexconvert.py` `--festival-dictionary-to-espeak` /usr/share/festival/dicts/oald/all.scm  
or if you can't install the Debian package, try downloading http://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/non-free/f/festlex-oald/festlex-oald_1.4.0.orig.tar.gz, unpack it into /tmp, and do: `python lexconvert.py` `--festival-dictionary-to-espeak` /tmp/festival/lib/dicts/oald/oald-0.4.out  
In all cases you need to cd to the eSpeak source directory before running this.  en_extra will be overwritten.  Converter will also read your `~/.festivalrc` if it exists.  (You can later incrementally update from `~/.festivalrc` using the `--convert` option; the entries from the system dictionary will not be overwritten in this case.)  Specify `--without-check` to bypass checking the existing eSpeak pronunciation for OALD entries (much faster, but makes a larger file and in some cases compromises the pronunciation quality).

--mac-uk `<from-format>` [`<text>`]
: Speak text in Mac OS 10.7+ British voices while using a lexicon converted in from `<from-format>`. As these voices do not have user-modifiable lexicons, lexconvert must binary-patch your system's master lexicon; this is at your own risk! (Superuser privileges are needed the first time. A backup of the system file is made, and all changes are restored on normal exit but if you force-quit then you might need to restore the backup manually. Text speaking needs to be under lexconvert's control because it usually has to change the input words to make them fit the available space in the binary lexicon.) By default the Daniel voice is used; Emily or Serena can be selected by setting the `MACUK_VOICE` environment variable.

--syllables [`<words>`]
: Attempt to break 'words' into syllables for music lyrics (uses espeak to determine how many syllables are needed)
